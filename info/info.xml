        <briefdescription>
        RGBDSLAM allows to quickly acquire colored 3D models of objects and
        indoor scenes with a hand-held Kinect-style camera. It provides a
        SLAM front-end based on visual features s.a. SURF or SIFT to match 
        pairs of acquired images, and uses RANSAC to robustly estimate the 
        3D transformation between them. The resulting camera pose graph is
        then optimized with the SLAM back-end HOG-Man.

        RGBDSLAM allows to quickly acquire colored 3D models of objects and
        indoor scenes with a hand-held Kinect-style camera. It uses visual
        features s.a. SURF or SIFT to match pairs of acquired images, and uses
        RANSAC to robustly estimate the 3D transformation between them. To
        achieve online processing, the current image is matched only versus a
        subset of the previous images.  Subsequently,
        it constructs a graph whose nodes correspond to camera views and whose
        edges correspond to the estimated 3D transformations.  The graph is
        then optimized with HOG-Man to reduce the accumulated pose errors.
